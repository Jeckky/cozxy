                In 1993, graphic designers Markus and Daniel Freitag were looking for a functional, water-repellent and
                robust bag to hold their creative work. Inspired by the multicolored heavy traffic that rumbled through
                the Zurich transit intersection in front of their flat, they developed a messenger bag from used truck
                tarpaulins, discarded bicycle inner tubes and car seat belts. This is how the first FREITAG bags took
                shape in the living room of their shared apartment – each one recycled, each one unique.

            <p class="size20">
                With their innovation, the brothers inadvertently triggered a seismic event in the world of bag making.
                Its tremors have since made themselves felt in Zurich and the cities of Europe and spread all the way to
                Asia, making FREITAG the unofficial outfitter of all urban, bike-riding individualists.

                The first F13 TOP CAT messenger bag has since spawned a range of over 70 different models designed to
                carry everything you can carry: from smartphone and laptop sleeves via shoppers and handbags to
                backpacks in various sizes, as well as the Haute Maroquinerie styles made from vintage truck tarps that
                has struck fear into the heart of the calf- and crocodile-recycling bag industry.

                Today our products are available in 16 F-STORES as well as at over 450 resellers around the world. In
                the FREITAG Online Store there's an extensive choice of over 5000 unique products. FREITAG has been
                headquartered at the Nœrd industrial complex in Zurich-Oerlikon since 2011. This is where the truck
                tarps we collect are taken apart, washed and cut up. FREITAG still belongs to the two Freitag brothers,
                and, as Creative Directors, they still oversee each new model through to series production.

                In 2014, they gave themselves a new raw material to play with: F-ABRIC. Their rugged, completely
                compostable textiles are based on bast fibers that are produced using a minimum of resources within a
                2500-kilometer radius of headquarters. F ABRIC thus more than lives up to the FREITAG philosophy: We
                think and act in cycles.
